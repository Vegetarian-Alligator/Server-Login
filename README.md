Remote Desktop Server Login
===========================

This is a login script oriented for trusted adminstrators of a minecraft server.  

Because administrating a game server does not recquire the skill of adiminstrating the remote CENTOs server on which it resides, this allows less technically inclinded users to perform common tasks without the support of more administrators.

Because of the need to establish an SSH tunnel, many non-programmers would find doing this without automation difficult.

These tasks include but are not limited to installing mods and restarting the server after a crash.  Editing the map is also a possibility if the local network will sustain such high levels of graphical data transfer.
